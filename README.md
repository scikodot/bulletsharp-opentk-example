# BulletSharp OpenTK Example
A simple example of using BulletSharp physics library with OpenTK. This project is based upon [the official example](https://github.com/AndresTraks/BulletSharp/tree/master/demos/OpenTK/BasicDemo) and demonstrates two basic functions, 
apart from those already implemented:
- collision detection (small cubes become orange when the first of them touches the large green cube)
- raycasting (when the mouse is hovering over any cube, small cubes change their color to magenta)

*Note: this is more of a template than a finished project; it is not commented out well and, consequently, may be not that much understandable.
If there's any need in explaining how all of that works, please let me know in the Issues tab.*
